		<h3>Interests in IT:</h3>
		<p>From the very childhood, it was easy to get me interested in almost any activity. I found out about programming a few years ago and wrote my first program not long before entering RMIT university. It was my dad who inspired me to try writing code. At the beginning, this occupation seemed to be boring and tiresome rather than exciting. Surprisingly, when I tried to create a game using video tutorial, programming has really fascinated me. The best part in IT for me is the huge potential for creating various originative projects. Programming can improve nearly every aspect of ​​our life. </p>
		<p> Australian education is considered as one of the most innovative in the world and at the same time the most affordable.That is why I decided to enter the RMIT university.
		<p id="idealJob">I hope that study in RMIT University will help me to expand my knowledge in different spheres such as IT,economics,web-design and managment. I also expect to learn more about working in group and making IT projects. </p>
		<h3>Ideal job:</h3>
		<p>My ideal job is Machine learning engineer at Grand Rounds. I am going to work on the healthcare problems.I will create machine learning technical specifications and build platform for model training.The reason why this position is so appealing to me is that the programmers in this modern company work for the benefit of humanity. The main objective of the projects is raising the level of healthcare. </p>
		<p>Evidently,for being a part of this great company you need a certain set of skills, qualifications and experience. Machine learning  engineers are required: </p>
		<ul>
			<li>to have excellent communication skills and be able to clearly articulate a complex concept. </li>
			<li>to be experienced with  different distributed systems componentry (SQL,NoSQL databases and ect. ). </li>
			<li>to have at list bachelor degree in a technical discipline and work experience depending on the qualification. </li>
			<li>to be able to work with SQL, Python, linux shell scripting. </li>
			<li>to be experienced in machine learning, and statistics fundamentals and also know how to work with production ready machine learning packages (scikit-learn, TensorFlow and etc. ). </li>
			<li>to be experienced in working with various workflow management solutions. </li>

		</ul>
		<p>At the moment I do not have any of the skills that are necessary for my ideal job. I am only at the beginning of studying Python and Java languages. </p>
		<p>However, I know in which direction I need to move in order to achieve my goal. In parallel with studying at the University, I will be studying Machine Learning in Python using online courses. They also include some topics from higher mathematics such as statistics and probabilities, which are significant for my future job. After I master the necessary skills, I can get an internship as a data science engineer. At about the same time I will graduate from RMIT University and receive an education that will be appreciated not only in Russia but also in foreign countries. I will work as a data science engineer for several years to get an experience and then find a work in an international company as Machine learning engineer. Then I will be able to get a visa and go abroad to work in a company similar to the one in the advertisment. </p>
		<p id ="personalprofile">This was my sample plan for getting the ideal job. </p>
		<h3 >Personal Profile:</h3>
		<p>Myers-Briggs test's results showed that I am an INFP(Introvert,iNtuitive,Feeling,Perceiving) type. The INFPs are guided by their principles rather than logic, emotion, or practicality. When deciding how to move forward, the INFPs will take into account honor, beauty, morality, and virtue. These statements are true for me. I am driven by my purity of intent, not reward or punishment. This trait of my personality influences on the choice of my profession and will be my guiding star throughout my career. Another test showed that I am a visual learner,which means that I understand and remember things by looking at them. Programmers are learning something new throughout their whole career. That is why knowing the best way to perceive information will be helpful for me. And the last one showed that I am strong-willed and result oriented person. Overall,  these test's results mean that I will be goal-oriented person who wants to work because of the certain principles and whose  best way to learn information is the visual one. I think these results may influence my behaviour in a team in the ambivalent way. I will be a respectful and discerning teamworker. People will be inspired by me. But at the same time because of my dominant personality I can be too agressive and rectilinear. However I believe that I will cope with my weaknesses. </p>
		<h3>Therapist.io Project:</h3>
		<p>Abstract</p>

		   <p>I have always been passionate about the Artificial Intelligence. The reason why is that so fascinating and bewitching for me is that this sphere of IT makes it possible to find solutions for the plenty of serious humanity's problems. I would really like to see different IT innovations that are connected with disease treatment. I hope that in the future I will develop an Artificial Intelligence that will help people to cope with various diseases. For my ideal job I need to have certain skills such as proficiency of machine learning, Python and Java and statistics fundamentals. This is just a list of some required skills, there are many more.</p>
		   <p>Overview</p>
	       <p>Psychiatry is a complex science and in many ways inaccurate. Often mental disorders have similar symptoms. The Therapist.io Project is an online consultant and disorder recognizer. This web-based application allows users to receive an instant consultation with a psychotherapist through an online system or mobile app. The application is full of various details related to mental illnesses. This project enables users to share their complaints and find out their diagnosis using artificial intelligence. The Artificial intelligence processes user specific details to check for various illnesses that could be associated with them. The system allows user to view doctor’s details and can be used for getting an online consultation at any time.</p>
		   <p>Motivation</p>
		   <p>"Existing models of care and available treatment approaches fail to adequately address the global crisis of mental health care. Mental illness accounts for about one-third of the world’s disability caused by all adult health problems, resulting in enormous personal suffering and socioeconomic costs."</p>

		   <p>Mental illness leads to suicide. It is one of the most common causes of preventable death among adolescents and young adults.</p>
		   <p>"Suicide is currently the second leading cause of death in 15 to 29 years old, resulting in enormous social disruption and losses in productivity."</p>
		   <p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5593510/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5593510/</a></p>

		    <p>It is not a secret that sometimes there is no opportunity for people with mental disorders to have a consultation with a doctor for any reasons. This can lead to serious consequences, in some cases even fatal. That is why this project is so important. It allows to search for doctor’s help at any point of time. Users can talk about their mental illnesses and get instant diagnosis by sharing their mental related issues.</p>


		    <p>Description</p>
	        <p>How this Therapist.io Project works?</p>

		    <p>-To begin with, the program is able to determine the user's diagnosis roughly. A medical diagnosis is considered to be an important but challenging task that needs to be performed accurately and efficiently. Doctor’s decision is often based on his or her intuition and experience rather than on the knowledge rich data hidden in the dataset. This leads to unwanted errors and biases which affect the patient’s subsequent treatment. The automation of diagnosing would be highly beneficial. A program which contains a huge amount of information about diseases and their symptoms will be able to determine the diagnosis in the accurate and effective way. The application asks for information about symptoms. The application processes user specific details to check for various illness that could be associated with it and guesses the most accurate diagnosis. The program outputs user's probable diagnosis and gives consistent steps to treat disease. According to symptoms, the application is able to determine the severity of the disease and, if necessary, recommend a mandatory visit to the doctor. This will reduce the amount of medical errors, enlarge patient safety, decrease unwanted practice variation, and improve the outcome of patients.</p>

		    <p>-It also contains information about rare symptoms and facts about mental illness. It can be very useful if a patient wants to find out an information connected with the illness that bothers the person.</p>

            <p>-One of the main advantages of this project is the ability to contact a doctor and get an online consultation at any convenient time. People with mental problems often find it difficult to see a doctor. For example, for people with social phobia even a little contact with society might be very stressful. Therefore, this application option is essential. A huge number of highly qualified doctors are registered in the database of the program. People with mental disease can schedule a consultation both online and offline. Information about the education and work experience of the doctor who interests him or her is also available to the user. Person can also read reviews on the doctor to understand the quality of his work. This can be useful if the user is looking for a great specialist who could prescribe the right medicine. When a doctor has the opportunity to give an online consultation, a special icon appears on his profile page. The user can set up a list of doctors so that only those specialists who are online are exposed. To get a consultation the user must call or write a doctor.</p>
